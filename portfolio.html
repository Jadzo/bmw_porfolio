        "BMW: A Legacy of Driving Excellence" traces the remarkable journey of
        Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), from its inception in 1916 as an
        aircraft engine manufacturer to its current status as a global icon of
        automotive innovation and luxury. In 1923, it adopted the name
        Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, marking the creation of the BMW brand. The
        company's motorcycles gained fame throughout the 1930s, with models like
        the R5 and R12 setting new standards for performance and reliability.
        After World War II, BMW faced challenges but rebounded with the BMW 501
        luxury sedan in 1951. The 1960s brought the era of the "New Class" of
        BMW cars, beginning with the BMW 1500 and later the revered BMW 2002.
        BMW's Motorsport division, established in 1972, produced iconic
        high-performance models such as the M3, M5, and M6. The modern era saw
        BMW expand its portfolio with SUVs like the X5 and luxury cars like the
        7 Series while embracing electric mobility with models like the i3 and
        i8. BMW continues to innovate, leading the way in technology and
        sustainability, with an eye on fully autonomous vehicles and further
        electrification. Today, BMW stands as a symbol of German engineering,
        inspiring automotive enthusiasts worldwide with a promising future.

          <h2 class="achTitleEach">BEST ELECTRIC EXECUTIVE CAR: THE BMW i4</h2>
          <p id="achbio">
            "This is the sort of car that, decades ago, built BMW's reputation.”
            - says Paul Horrell, Top Gear. <br /><br />
            On why Top Gear gave the award to the BMW i4, Horrell also said:
            "Because it shows how electric cars can throw off their shackles.
            They aren't eccentric or oddball or compromised. An i4 costs the
            same on finance as a 430i. The i4 began with one of the best
            all-round car formats from one of the best all-round carmakers. They
            electrified it with commitment and expertise, and the result is as
            good as or better than something fuelled by petrol."

          <h2 class="achTitleEach">BMW M5 CS 5 STAR ROAD TEST.</h2>
          <p id="achbio">
            The impressive BMW M5 CS was the only car to be awarded the 5 Star
            road test verdict.
            <br /><br />
            "The BMW M5 CS is the super-saloon to rule them all… a timely
            reminder what BMW does best… and a fitting award too, as BMW M
            celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.”
            <br /><br />
            In reference to BMW as Best Manufacturer, “...the engineering is as
            fine as it ever was, something most aptly demonstrated by cars like
            the M5 CS, which shows that BMW hasn’t lost its ability to really
            interrogate the details and hunt marginal gains in the pursuit of
            brilliance.”

          <p id="achbio">
            At the other end of the spectrum, the unique BMW i3 was recognised
            as a future classic car achieving an Autocar-Beaulieu Future Classic
            Award. “The leadership and legacy BMW i has built up over the past
            decade in electric cars started with the i3….already a legend in its
            own lifetime. It was the unanimous choice of judges and readers
            alike.”<br /><br />
            “So despite a great start in the EV game, BMW’s traditional sporting
            pretensions remain in rude health. It’s our Manufacturer of the
            Year.
