              The BMW 5 Series, a prominent executive car, has been a flagship
              offering from BMW since 1972, succeeding the New Class Sedans. Now
              in its seventh generation, it has evolved over the years,
              initially starting as a sedan and later expanding to include a
              wagon/estate ("Touring") in 1991 and a 5-door fastback ("Gran
              Turismo") from 2009 to 2017. Each generation has its internal
              E-designation, and the lineup has seen a variety of engine
              options, including naturally aspirated four-cylinders,
              six-cylinders, V8s, and even V10s, both naturally aspirated and
              turbocharged, alongside diesel engines since 1982. This model
              holds significant importance for BMW, being the
              second-best-selling in their lineup after the 3 Series, and it
              marked the beginning of BMW's three-digit model naming convention,
              making it the pioneer in utilizing "Series" in its name. Notably,
              on January 29, 2008, BMW celebrated the production of the 5
              millionth 5 Series vehicle, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic.

              The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury SUV that marked BMW's entry into
              the SUV market when it debuted in 1999 as the E53 model. This
              launch featured all-wheel drive and manual or automatic
              transmission options. The second generation, known as the E70, was
              introduced in 2006 and introduced the xDrive all-wheel drive
              system with an automatic gearbox. In 2009, the high-performance X5
              M variant was released. BMW officially termed the X5 as a "Sports
              Activity Vehicle" (SAV) rather than an SUV to highlight its
              on-road handling capabilities despite its larger size. It was a
              pioneer in shifting from body-on-frame to monocoque chassis
              construction. The X5 is primarily manufactured in North America,
              with assembly in various other countries, including Russia, India,
              Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. This model also served as the
              foundation for BMW's expansion into the SAV series, including the
              X3 and X6.

              The BMW iX is a noteworthy mid-size luxury crossover SUV in BMW's
              lineup, representing a significant milestone in the German
              automaker's electric vehicle journey. Initially revealed as the
              Vision iNext concept at the 2018 Paris Motor Show, it transitioned
              into a fully production-ready vehicle by November 2020. Notably,
              the iX is BMW's first purpose-built electric vehicle since the i3
              introduced in 2013 and serves as the fourth model in the BMW i
              sub-brand. The choice of the "iX" nameplate reflects its status as
              the flagship electric vehicle in BMW's lineup, showcasing the
              latest fifth-generation electric drive system technology while
              offering advanced autonomous and connected features.

              The BMW 4 Series, introduced in 2013 and currently in its second
              generation, represents a range of compact executive cars that
              stemmed from BMW's decision to separate the 2-door models (coupé
              and convertible) of the 3 Series into a distinct series. Initially
              unveiled as a concept at the 2013 North American International
              Auto Show, the 4 Series encompasses coupé, convertible, and 5-door
              liftback (marketed as "Gran Coupé") body styles. Engine options
              for the first generation included turbocharged inline-3, inline-4,
              and inline-6 engines, running on either petrol or diesel, with the
              second generation introducing a plug-in hybrid powertrain. The
              drivetrain layout mirrors that of the equivalent 3 Series
              generations, offering rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive
              ("xDrive"). For enthusiasts seeking high performance, the BMW M4
              serves as the high-performance variant, featuring a turbocharged
              inline-six petrol engine similar to the M3.

              The BMW 2 Series, introduced in 2014, is a versatile range of
              subcompact executive cars that emerged as a distinct series when
              BMW separated the 2-door models (coupé and convertible) from the
              BMW 1 Series. Initially launched as 2-door coupés and convertibles
              on a rear-wheel-drive platform, the 2 Series family expanded to
              include an Active Tourer 5-seat compact MPV and a 7-seat Gran
              Tourer, both built on a front-wheel-drive platform shared with the
              Mini Hatch. In 2019, the Gran Coupé fastback sedan joined as a
              front-wheel-drive vehicle based on the 1 Series hatchback. In
              2021, BMW released the second-generation 2-door coupé, featuring
              rear-wheel drive. For performance enthusiasts, the BMW M2 serves
              as the high-performance variant, boasting turbocharged
              straight-six engines in its first-generation F87 coupé model.
